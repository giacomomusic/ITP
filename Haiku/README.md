# Haiku Assignment
####Giacomo Messina, 5 February 2026
#####What I did?
This week I used the terminal application on my computer to program the voice "samantha" to record a .aiff file into my Haiku folder. 
#####How I did it?
I started with finding a Haiku on the internet, I ended up using one with the text "I tend my garden as a meditation. hop in a broken world." After that I followed along the same code along I used in class to first 'ls' which lists the files in my working director. I then 'cd' changed my directory to "Programming Class" which is the folder I use in my harddrive. I then pwd to double check I was in the correct spot. Finally I used the commmand 'say' to make the voice "samantha" speak the haiku before finally printing it '-o' as a .aiff
#####Problems and Solutions. 
I did not run into any problems this week as I carefully followed along the same steps as the code along in class. If I did run into problems I would have double checked my code as it compared to the code along on git and/or used pwd to continue to double check my working directory. 
##### Other code 
In this assignment besides refrencing the class git I did not use any other code.
