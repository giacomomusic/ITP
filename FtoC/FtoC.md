# FtoC HW

## What you did?

This week I used javaScript in order to code the calculation from 99 degrees fahrenheit to celcius. 

## How you did it?

I used the materials from class alongside my own intuition in order to code this calculation in javaScript. My final code ended up being:

```
let f = 99
let c = (((f-32)*(5/9)))
console.log((c)
```

##Problems you faced/ how you fixed them?

During the initial writing of the code I was trying to write out the equation and javaScript did not like when I was not very specific with my order of operations. I originally did not have parathesis around the second half of the equation but after adding them it immidiatley solved the problem. 

The only other problem I had was I defied both f and c a second time as both Farenheit and Celcius but that ended up causing problems. If I asked to print "Celcius" instead of "c" it would give me just the letter c instead of the answer to the equation. After removing this second variable to both it made it a lot simpler and easier to read and for the computer to run.
