## 1 "Values, Typos, and Operators"

#### Did Know

In this first chapter of the reading there wasn't a lot that I was comforatable with but I did understand Boolean Values and I knew a bit about the logical operations from other tech classes in school. 

#### Didn't Know

I didn't know a lot about this information but I do not understand a bit about automatic type conversion. I can't quite grasp what it means that Java knows what is wrong and right? I think it has something with how it reads multiple things as the same but I'd definetley like to go further in depth on it. 

## 2 "Program Structure"

#### Did Know

Through earlier computer technology classes in school I was already famiiliar with some bindings (I believe through programs like Scratch). I understood immidiately "var" and "const" even though I hadn't seen it in a while it feels familiar and I think I can put it into context of our class prety quickly. 

#### Didn't Know

There was a lot of specific programming language in this chapter that I was unfamiliar with but I specifically did not really get the loop code and understanding that, I also didn't quite grasp if it matters if our code is indented versus in one line I think they explained it will read anything but I'm not sure. I also need to dig deeper in the conditional execution, the code started getting long very quickly and my brain was instantly lost. 

## 3 "Functions"

#### Did Know

Although a lot of the lanuage itself felt new I did know about and understand functions. Functions are what make everything happen in programming and although I might not know speficic language I do understand what they do. The next step for me is definetly grasping more of the specific language to be able to write it myself. 

#### Didn't Know

I did not know but now understand a lot of the specific function programs. I am starting to grasp the concept of scopes but I think I really only understand binding. I beleive that scopes are how the program actually reads the text that we put into it and knowing what it can and can't read helps us eventually code faster and more efficient. If I'm wrong I'm sure I'll relearn soon but this chapter was a mix of familiar and extremely difficult subjects.
